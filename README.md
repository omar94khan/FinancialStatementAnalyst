# Automated Financial Statement Analyst 

In the banking world, money talks. And we all know that time is money. It is your Corporate Relationship Managers that are the ones out there bringing in large ticket transactions that make the bank money, and in order to do that the RM must perform an Annual Review of the client's annual financial statements. This is a time consuming task wherein the client must first extract the client's latest annual statement, note down the data, and then analyze the trends in the financials, as well as forecast their future performance. 

Having worked as a Corporate Banker myself, I realize how tedious this activity is when piled on top of your already plate-full of tasks. So I have now decided to build a website that will help extract the latest financial statements for your large corporate clients (using the Yahoo Finance dataset for the Very Large and Large sized listed corporations around the globe) and analyze the trends in their performance. The goal of this application is to help save time for the RM, while also providing an accurate analysis of the client's financials - allowing the bank to make decisions regarding how to build on the client's relationship and extend more, or fewer, credit facilities to the client.
